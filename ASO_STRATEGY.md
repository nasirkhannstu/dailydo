## App Store Metadata

### App Name (30 characters max)
**Primary Option:** `DailyDo: Tasks & Habits`
- Includes top keyword "Tasks"
- Brand name memorable
- 23 characters (room to spare)

**Alternative Options:**
- `DailyDo - Daily Planner` (24 chars)
- `DailyDo: Habit Tracker` (23 chars)
- `DailyDo Todo & Habits` (22 chars)

**Recommendation:** Use `DailyDo: Tasks & Habits`
- "Tasks" has higher search volume than "Todo"
- "Habits" is unique differentiator
- Balanced appeal

### Subtitle (30 characters max)
**Primary Option:** `Todo, Habits & Goals Tracker`
- Covers 3 main features
- Keyword-rich
- 28 characters

**Alternative Options:**
- `Plan, Track & Achieve Goals` (27 chars)
- `Daily Planner with Templates` (29 chars)
- `Organize Life, Build Habits` (28 chars)

**Recommendation:** `Todo, Habits & Goals Tracker`
- Most keyword-dense
- Clear value proposition

### Promotional Text (170 characters, updateable anytime)
```
🎯 New: 20+ Ready-Made Templates!
Water Intake, Exercise, Medication, Meal Plans & more.

```

**Update Strategy:**
- Change monthly with new features/templates
- Highlight seasonal templates (holiday, New Year, summer)
- A/B test different messaging

### Keywords Field (100 characters, comma-separated, no spaces)
**Primary Keywords (57 chars):**
```
todo,habit,task,planner,routine,fitness,goals,tracker,productivity
```

**Extended Keywords (100 chars exactly):**
```
todo,habit,task,planner,routine,fitness,goals,tracker,productivity,daily,checklist,reminder,organize
```

**Alternative Set (Template-focused - RECOMMENDED):**
```
water,exercise,medication,skincare,dental,pets,prayer,reading,steps,meal,habit,routine,tracker,plan
```

**SEO Rationale:**
This set targets specific, high-intent searches that match our 10 habit templates:
- water (Water Intake template)
- exercise (Exercise template)
- medication (Medication template)
- skincare (Skin Care template)
- dental (Dental Care template)
- pets (Feed Pets template)
- prayer (Prayer Time template)
- reading (Daily Reading template)
- steps (Steps Goal template)
- meal (Healthy Breakfast template)

**Recommendation:** Start with Primary, test Alternative after 3 months

**Keyword Research Notes:**
- Avoid duplicate words (e.g., if "habit tracker" in name, don't use both in keywords)
- Use singular form only (App Store handles plurals)
- No need for "app" suffix
- Competitor brand names NOT allowed

## Visual Assets Strategy

### App Icon
